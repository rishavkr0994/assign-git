What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
-> A .gitignore file is a file which instructs git on the files it should 
not track. For a Java project, this should include compiled class files 
(.class), log files (.log), IDE specific files, etc.

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
-> A fast forward is when git can simply move the source branch pointer to
the target branch pointer during a merge, without the need to create a merge
commit.

Why should you have different branches?
-> The benefit of having different branches is that each developer can branch
out from master and work independently on his code. Later, once finished, the
developer can merge his changes onto the master branch. There are other uses
of a branch too, like if some new feature is being developed which may cause
unstability, then it is a good idea to branch out from master and develop
the feature in this new branch.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
-> It depends on the size of the project. In small projects a single 
repository may be enough, but in larger projects we may need to have 
multiple repositories.
